# Datepicker demo
An accessible datepicker widget, used to demonstrate a process for building accessible components. Start with the page called Step 1 and look at the changes between the steps. 

HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. Not intended for use in production! If you want a more reliable datepicker in plugin form, I recommend the [open-source version of Duet's date-picker](https://github.com/duetds/date-picker). If you want to know how to make user-friendly date-pickers, take a look at Russ Weakley's talk [What makes an accessible date-picker?](https://www.youtube.com/live/D2Gy2WN4Iys).
