# Datepicker demo
An accessible datepicker widget, used to demonstrate a process for building accessible components. See [the original talk](https://noti.st/stringy/jQVbBm/building-accessible-components) on Noti.st for more information. 

HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript. Not intended for use in production! If you want a more reliable datepicker in plugin form, I recommend the [open-source version of Duet's date-picker](https://github.com/duetds/date-picker).
